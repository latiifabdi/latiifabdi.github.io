			<h2 class="font-normal text-grey-darkest mb-4">Brief history</h2>
			<p class="leading-loose" style="color: #3d4852;">
				I started software development while still in high school, after being introduced to programming by a friend.
				 My first programs were written in C. 
				 I had the privilege of working there for over a 5 years, spending most of my time building marketing websites for small businesses.
				 In 2016 I said farewell to start my own freelance software company.
				  I have been doing contract work since then.
				   Much of my time has been spent building some amazing tools.

		<div class="mt-4 w-4/5">
			<h2 class="font-normal text-grey-darkest mb-4">Web development</h2>
			<p class="leading-loose mb-3" style="color: #3d4852;">
				My primary focus as a software developer is on web development, which I have been doing since the late 2014. My first projects were built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. Interestingly, my toolset remains much the same today. These days my PHP framework of choice is Laravel. These days I'm doing much of my JavaScript work with Vue.js.
				
			</p>
			<p class="leading-loose" style="color: #3d4852;">
				As a developer I value well written code, that's easy to read, and isn't unnecessarily complex. I don't see automated testing as optional, but rather a key part of writing good code. I appreciate following industry set coding standards. I make a point of continually learning and improving through attending conferences, reading books and blogs, watching screencasts, and following industry experts.
